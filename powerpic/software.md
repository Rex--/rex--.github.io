# PowerP/C Software

## Compilation

Currently, Microchip's `xc8-cc` compiler is used to compile and link the [firmware](/powerpic/fw) for the powerpic. A simple Makefile is provided in the [pic-resources](https://github.com/Rex--/pic-resources) repo.

Development is done on Arch btw, using `microchip-mplabxc8-bin` from the AUR.

In the future I would like to migrate to the currently unmainted PIC16 branch of the [SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net).
